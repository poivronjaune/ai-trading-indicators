I want to develop a new python package that will use CSV Files as input. 
I want you to help me write a PRD (Product Requirements Document) to help generate weel structured python code.

The app is a simple package called indicators.
Here are some elements to consider:
- Function to download price data that is stored in data folder.
- The file format must be a CSV file with the following columns: NotUsed,Datetime,Adj Close,Close,High,Low,Open,Volume
- The first column will not be used so we do not worry abut it's title or it's content
- The data must be loaded in a pandas dataframe, each row must have a unique datetime, ignore duplicates datetimes
- The code must use the TA-Lib python package
- Assume there is a wheel file similar to "ta_lib-0.6.4-cp313-cp313-win_amd64.whl" that must be installed using pip tools
- We will need a TOML file to configure tha package, make sur the author is called "Robert Boivin" with email:poivronjaune@gmail.com
- In the readme file place a note at the bottom to link to this repository to download the proper ta-lib wheel file : https://github.com/cgohlke/talib-build and explain the files are located in the release section
- The app must offer a simple console interface to select a data folder and a filename
- There must be an api to use the package and run it programmatically
- Once the data is loaded, indicators must be added and then the file must saved in another folder with name of the source folder appended with "_ind", the file with indicators must be called the same as the ticker that was loaded (the soucre filename)
- Default indicators to add : SMA and EMA with these lookback windows (5, 10, 14, 20, 50, 100, 200), bollinger bands with the most common parameters
- Let's make sure the indicators can be called independently from one another and that we can add more later or programmatically
- If called from command line, give feedback on progress

So build a PRD document that I will use to generate an app with and I will propose it to many LLM available.

The PRD must be markdown that I can cut & paste to my project as it will be distributed with the code




CODE Generation
- ChatGPT -> did not work
I have uploaded a nice PRD and I want you to generate a python project with it. Start by showing me the folder srutcure of my project. I will have teh Readm file at the root of my project (it is called ai-trading-indicators), I want my package name inside this root folder to be ind. Generate a TOML File with proper dependencies and best practices, make sur ethere is a script section to launch a default execution of my indicator package that will prompt the user for the data folder and the filename of the ticker data. When you repsond to this query I want you to do it step by step, starting with the file folders then wait for me to ask for teh next step

Reached end of conversation limit, could not download the files one by one.
Overly complicated.

I do not want any tests, and keep a simple architecture for our code files.
